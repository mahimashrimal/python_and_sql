•	This project creates a basic voice-controlled virtual assistant with a graphical interface.
•	The assistant can perform tasks like answering questions about its name, searching the web, finding locations on Google Maps, providing the current time, and playing music on YouTube.
•	The GUI provides a user-friendly way to interact with the assistant.
•	The script uses various external libraries to handle speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and web interactions.
Key Features:
•	Speech Recognition:
o	Utilizes the speech_recognition library to capture and convert user's spoken commands into text.
•	Text-to-Speech Conversion:
o	Employs the pyttsx3 library for converting text responses into speech, allowing the virtual assistant to communicate audibly.
•	Command Processing:
o	Recognizes and processes various voice commands, including inquiries about its name, performing web searches, finding locations, providing the current time, playing music, and exiting.
•	Graphical User Interface (GUI):
o	Creates a simple GUI using the tkinter library, allowing users to interact with the virtual assistant through buttons.
•	Web Interaction:
o	Uses the webbrowser library to interact with web browsers, enabling functionalities like web searches and finding locations on Google Maps.
•	Dynamic Audio Playback:
o	Incorporates the playsound library for playing dynamically generated audio responses in response to user queries.
•	Image Display:
o	Displays an image in the GUI using the PIL (Python Imaging Library) and ImageTk to enhance the user interface.
•	Time-related Functionality:
o	Utilizes the time library to provide information about the current time when prompted by the user.
•	Dynamic Text Updates:
o	Updates the text display area in the GUI with responses from the virtual assistant.
•	Modular Code Structure:
o	Organizes the code into functions and classes, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.
•	Exception Handling:
o	Implements basic exception handling to manage potential errors during speech recognition.
•	User-Friendly Interaction:
o	Provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for speaking and closing the assistant, enhancing the overall user experience.
•	These features collectively contribute to the creation of a voice-controlled virtual assistant with interactive capabilities, making it capable of understanding user commands and providing responses through both text and speech.
